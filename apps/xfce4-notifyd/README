The Xfce Notify Daemon (or "xfce4-notifyd") is a small program that implements
the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop notifications
specification. Applications that wish to pop up a notification bubble in a
standard way can implicitly make use of xfce4-notifyd to do so by sending
standard messages over D-Bus using the org.freedesktop.Notifications
interface.

Apart from the notification server a panel plugin is included which shows recent
notifications in a dropdown menu in the Xfce Panel.
