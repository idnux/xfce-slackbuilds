Xfce4 Dictionary is a client program to query different dictionaries


This program allows you to search different kinds of dictionary services
for words or phrases and shows you the result.
Currently you can query a "Dict" server(RFC 2229), any online dictionary
service by opening a web browser or search for words using a spell check
program like aspell, ispell or enchant.

xfce4-dict contains a stand-alone application called "xfce4-dict" and a
panel plugin for the Xfce panel.
