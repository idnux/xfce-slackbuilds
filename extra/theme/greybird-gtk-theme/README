greybird-gtk-theme

grey GTK+ theme from the Shimmer Project

Greybird has been the default theme for Xubuntu since 2011 when it replaced 
Bluebird. Greybird can be described as more conservative yet more modern 
than Bluebird. The Shimmer Project are the designers and developers of both 
themes.

Although originally created for Xfce, Greybird also supports other GTK+-
based environments including Cinnamon, GNOME Shell, MATE, and Unity.
