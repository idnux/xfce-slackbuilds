UPower is an abstraction for enumerating power devices, listening to device
events and querying history and statistics. Any application or service on
the system can access the org.freedesktop.UPower service via the system
message bus. Some operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted
using PolicyKit.

UPower was once called DeviceKit-power. UPower aims to make a large chunk
of HAL redundant, as HAL is officially deprecated.

UPower is also useful to control the latency of different operations on
your computer, which enables you to save significant amounts of power.
Nothing much uses this interface yet, but this is a classic chicken and egg
scenario, and I think it's important to encourage the egg to lay a chicken.
Please report any problems to the Freedesktop bugzilla or send a mail to
the DeviceKit mailing list for discussion.
