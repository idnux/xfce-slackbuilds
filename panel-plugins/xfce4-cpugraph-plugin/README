xfce4-cpugraph-plugin offers multiple display modes (LED, gradient, fire,
etcâ€¦) to show the current CPU load of the system. Various appearance
options, like colors or size, are customizable.

On multi core or multi CPU systems, CPU Graph can either track and display
all of them at once, or at the user's option only a specific core or CPU.
